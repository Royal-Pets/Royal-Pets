## Cooperation Plan
#### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
Each member of the team contributes their fair share of the workload and fully understands what their responsibilities are and where they fit. They feel a sense of belonging to the team, are committed to their work, and really care about the success of the Project. 
#### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
Communicate openly with each other, sharing their thoughts, opinions, and ideas with members of their team; as well as taking into consideration what others have to say 
#### In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
They agree on and set team goals based on outcomes and results, rather than just on the amount of work being done. A clear plan can then be set about how they are going to achieve these objectives, as a group, as well as each individual’s contribution. This provides them with clear direction and gives them something to aim for collectively. 
#### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
Though each individual should be responsible for organizing their own workload, management should ensure that everything is running to plan and each member of the team is getting their work completed efficiently. Holding regular meetings can help to make sure that everyone is on the same page and deadlines are being met. 

## Conflict Plan
#### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
Summarize the areas of agreement and disagreement, And ask the each person if he or she agrees with other assessment, To modify the assessment until both of them agree on the areas of conflict.
#### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
Working with someone who isn't a team player is not only frustrating, it can impair the entire team's performance, Starting a dialogue with the team member in question, but approach him or her with friendly questions, not accusations. Helpful questions that indicate your support for the individual could include: "What else are you working on right now?" or "What motivates you the most?" according to the report. 
#### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
Clarify the team's mission. An uncooperative team member may indicate that something is off with the group. Perhaps the team's approach isn't working or the mission isn't clear enough. Revisit the group's shared vision and mission and clarify best methods for fulfilling them. 
#### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
The issue of a disengaged team member could become exacerbated if the team decides to shun the person who isn't carrying his or her weight, To promote better cohesion, ask the person out for coffee or lunch and try to get to know him or her better, and bring a few other coworkers along.
#### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
When a conflict affects the whole team, provided it's not sensitive or confidential, we can ask for everyone's perspective. Talking things out helps the team to consider different assumptions, beliefs and decision-making approaches.

## Communication Plan

10:00 Am to 17:00pm

Slack and Zoom
#### How often will you take breaks?
every 2 hours
#### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
There may be less time in the day to work on important things once we fall behind schedule. However, this just means that we need to prioritize tasks. Determine 1 or 2 things that need to get done by a set deadline. See if we can push back other less important tasks and focus on our prioritize for the remainder of the time that we have.
##### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
Using both Slack and Zoom
##### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
Give everyone the time and opportunity to present their own perspective on events and to respond to any criticism. It's vital that all parties are able to state their case and are listened to. 
##### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
If the efforts at conflict resolution didn't work, we have to be willing to pursue formal procedures if necessary. And some situations, such as harassment, discrimination or bullying, require a formal disciplinary process to be followed.
